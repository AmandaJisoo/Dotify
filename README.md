# Dotify
## Your App by Amanda Park
# App Description
This is a music app like Spotify
1. A user can rotate screen and data persists
2. A user can click setting icon on the nav bar and see fragment settings
3. A user able to visit profile, profile statistics, and about page


## Extra credit
I have completed the following 

1. Every Fragment (other than SettingsFragment) has a Up/back button in the top right corner. Clicking
will take you back to the previous fragment (+.25)
2. Instead of Settings <Button> in your layout from requirement #1, make a Settings "Action Button‚Äù in
the app bar (header bar at the top). https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/actions (+.25)
